# 🎲 Number Guessing Game in C

A simple console-based **Number Guessing Game** written in C.  
The program generates a random number within a range, and the player must guess it.  
After each attempt, the program provides hints:  
- **Too high** if the guess is larger than the number  
- **Too low** if the guess is smaller than the number

## 🤔 Why is this project useful?
- Practices **control flow** in C (loops and conditionals).  
- Introduces the use of **random numbers** with `rand()` and `srand()`.  
- Helps improve **user interaction** via standard input/output.
